# Vite + React + TypeScript Components

This project contains two React components built using **Vite, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS**:

1. **InputField** – A flexible input component with support for labels, helper text, password toggle, clear button, and different sizes/variants.
2. **DataTable** – A dynamic table component with support for sorting, selectable rows, loading state, and empty state messages.

Both components are documented and previewed using **Storybook**.
